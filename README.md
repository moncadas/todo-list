# To Do List

## Personal note
That's a small project made in about 8 hours with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.
**Purpose:** test with practise what I've learned so far.

## Usage
The user must first type something in the text area, then click on the **Insert button** to add it to the list.
Any entry of the list can be checked as completed by clicking on the checkbox on the left side, or deleted by clicking on the **X button** on the right.

The user can choose to clear the list by clicking on the **Clear List button**.
