# To Do List
Just a small project using vanilla JS to test what I've learned so far.

The user must type anything on the text field then click on the 'Insert' button.
For any note on the list the user can change its status to 'Done' by clicking on the checkbox, or delete it.

It is also possible to clear the list by clicking on the 'Clear list' button.
That's it. Pretty simple, uh?
